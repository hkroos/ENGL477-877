        <p>How does one go about defining an accomplished Digital Humanities project? Should the project be judged solely on what it accomplished, or should an amount of credence be given to what the project aimed to accomplish? These question have to be answered while investigating a project that not only involves what is on the surface, the front-end, but also what occurs on the coding level, the back-end. This paper seeks to explore what factors and caveats should be employed in the definition of an adept DH project, and some of the theories that shape these metrics. </p>
    <p> One of the first theories that shape what should define an excellent DH project is that belief that the design of the project should allow it to reach the largest population possible. That is to say, regardless of disability or ability the project should be accessible to all. This theory is exemplified in George Williams essay “Disability, Universal Design, and the Digital Humanities.”(1) In his essay, Williams states that “digital knowledge tools that assume everyone approaches information with the same abilities and using the same methods risk excluding a large percentage of people.” His is a wonderful, often unspoken, point. In our current theory of the Digital Humanities, inclusiveness is often at the forefront of discussion. Projects should not be limited in viewership and participation by the error of not designing with accessibility in mind. The sin of non-accessibility is furthered when tools and guides for openness have a home within the Web Accessibility Initiative. The WAI provides intuitive guides and checklist that allow for the implementation of the WAI standards from the first line of code written for a project. These standards include obvious ideals of openness by have alternative text included with pictures and photos to allow for those with limited use of sight to understand what is presented in a project. Some of the less obvious cues to work with are including the ability to change the size or color of the text and background on a page as this allows the user to shape the page to their needs. The idea that openness be included within the project itself is summed up on the WAI website stating that “the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recognizes access to information and communications technologies, including the Web, as a basic human right.”</p>
    <p> Building on the idea that a project make itself available to the widest audience available, it is necessary to discuss the philosophy that inclusion take place within the project teams, and intention of the project at large. Although a DH project may begin with the most egalitarian ambitions, without consideration given to the themes of representation a project may unintentionally create problems it aimed to solve. To put this another way it should be inquired “who, or what, does this enterprise represent, and is are is it going about it in a balanced approach?” As Elizabeth Losh, Jacqueline Wernimont, Laura Wexler, and Hong-An Wu put it in their essay Putting the Human Back into the Digital Humanities, Feminism, Generosity, and Mess “too narrow a vision for the digital humanities obscures important conflicts among users, including contentious issues about how structures of power and privilege can be reproduced in computational systems.” It may seem obvious, but without inquirye into the underlying philosophy of a team, and project aim, an enterprise may become another bad actor in an internet filled with them.</p>
    <p>After investigating how to improve the reach of Digital Humanities, and include the largest amount of diversity within the field it is important to note what happens to an enterprise after the investigating and building is complete. Is there any plan on how to continue this project in spite of changing software and codes? Will there be updates with new research? Is this webpage or archive going to be around in five years, ten years? I believe there is a notion that just because something is uploaded to the internet that there will be an inherent permanence to it, and that little to no effort will be necessary after an initial launch. This could not be further from the truth. Just because the site is still available at a URL does not mean that every link will still be active, or that every tool or program will still be compatible with a browser’s current format. The aging of a project can be as simple as the layout becoming archaic and uninteresting to a new audience. This is evidence by the myriad of projects from as recent as the new millennium that no longer function as they were originally intended. This is an important point of inspection not only for the health of current projects, but the overall staying power of the Digital Humanities as a whole. A discipline of study is unsustainable if a large amount of funded projects become idle and forgotten about in lieu of new, exciting, projects. As grant applications more and more include the planning for projects going forward this problem can be remedied. This is coupled with the National Endowment for the Humanities now giving grants for “revitalizing and/or recovering existing digital projects that promise to contribute substantively to scholarship, teaching, or public knowledge of the humanities.” It may sound obvious, but to preserve the majority of DH projects is to preserve the field.</p>
    <p> What is to be made then of these theories on what attributes a DH project should include? When does the idealism of wanting a long-term funded project that includes provisions for upkeep give way to the reality of a limited budget and staff? When does the want of creating a project by a diverse group of individuals for a diverse group of individuals become an exercise in yak rather than hack? The reality of any given project creates many difficult decisions in the allocation of capital and time. The idea of project that is funded for the long term future will be out of reach for many grant applicants, and this is the truth of, not only academics, but also most of life. On the second point though, in addressing concepts of accessibility from the beginning of any projects allows for the greatest chance that any undertaking will be able to meet the needs of the largest user base. Furthermore, in deciding early what the avenue of examination will bring to the table, and who is bringing it, will allow for the most discussion and openness in the prospective design. </p>
    <p> To bring all of this together, what constitutes an excellent Digital Humanities project? An excellent DH project is one that decides from the outset that it would like to be available to the largest audience possible. This could often entail extra work including alternative text for photographs, including transcription of audio and video, and writing in tools that allow the page to become malleable to users needs. An excellent DH project is not one that needs large grants to cover updating throughout the years after it has gone live. An accomplished project can one that has gone out it’s way to research different coding methods to allow for the easiest transition through time and evolving coding. The project could be developed with open source coding in mind that would allow for the smoothest transitions into new browser standards. An excellent DH project is one that takes to time to interrogate the methodologies at play in the desired outcome of a project, and if the data itself is the best representation of that desire. </p>
